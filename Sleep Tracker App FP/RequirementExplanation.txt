Requirements
------------

-Two Activities that implement a useful function
-Data must transfer between the two activities
-Recycler View
-Menu/Navigation Bar to help with app mobility
-Needs to Fragments with at least one transition event


How the app works
---------------
Our two activities include the opening screen the user can start and stop their sleep, and our second activity is
allows the user to rate the quality of their sleep after they stop it.  Our useful function is tracking sleep for
the user to better understand their sleeping habits.

The data transfers through the two main activities by storing the ratings from the second activity in rows on the 
first activity.

The recycler view comes into play once the user has stopped and started enough sleep cycles to fill up the page.  
At this point the new sleep cycles will then go below the scope of the page and the user can scroll up and down to
find all their sleep cycle ratings.

Our navigation comes in the form of our stop start and clear buttons.  The clear button deletes all stored data and
resets the recycler view, and the second activity automatically returns to the main page when a rating is given.

Our fragments come in the form of our sleep rating robots and the transition has them sliding in.
